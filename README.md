# HR-Analysis-Dashboard
# OVERVIEW
This project is designed with the primary objective of gaining comprehensive and descriptive insights into various aspects of employee information within our organization. 
By analyzing and summarizing employee data, we aim to better understand the composition.
Through this analysis, I seek to answer essential questions about employees in the dataset, including their demographics, tenure, performance, and satisfaction levels. 
Additionally, wI aim to identify patterns and trends.

# DATA
in oder to achieve this descriptive analysis, I made use of a HR dataset which is available on this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h4bvZlHJUFAYJ5CbleAmLr6muAX1Q7rm/view

Here are some common aspects of employee data were analyzed descriptively:

Tenure: This metric indicates the duration of time that employees have spent with the company.
Satisfaction: This metric represents the rate of employee job satisfaction.
Overtime: additional hours that an employee works beyond their regular or standard working hours. Overtime is typically associated with an increase in pay rate, often at a higher 
          rate than the employee's regular hourly wage, as a form of compensation for the extra time worked.
Promotion: his metric distinguishes between employees who are eligible for promotion and those who are not.
Distance: This metric measures the proximity of each employee's place of residence to the office.
Layoffs: This metric represents the number of staff members who need to be retrenched.

# RESULT
# Pattern Analysis: Employee Satisfaction and Overtime
-High Satisfaction Employees:

Among the 569 employees who reported high job satisfaction, 153 of them engage in overtime work. This suggests that a significant proportion of employees with high job satisfaction
are willing to invest extra time and effort in their roles.

-Low Satisfaction Employees:

Conversely, among the 459 employees who expressed low job satisfaction, 142 of them are also involved in overtime work. This pattern suggests that a portion of employees with lower job
satisfaction may be compensating by working additional hours, possibly as a means to address job-related challenges.

-Neutral Satisfaction Employees:

Among the 442 employees who remain neutral regarding their job satisfaction, 121 of them participate in overtime work. This finding indicates that even among those who maintain a neutral
stance on job satisfaction, a notable segment is actively engaged in overtime tasks.

# Conclusion
Overall, these patterns suggest that there is a varied relationship between job satisfaction and overtime. These insights underscore the complexity of the factors influencing employee 
engagement and the need for a complex approach to address job satisfaction and overtime practices
Further analysis is required to explore the reasons behind these patterns, such as the nature of the tasks requiring overtime, the impact of overtime on job satisfaction over time,
and potential interventions to optimize both employee well-being and productivity


# Pattern Analysis: Retrenchment Across Organizational Levels
In my evaluation of the first five levels within the organization, I uncovered a distinct pattern in the number of staff and the corresponding retrenchment figures:
-Level 1:

This level comprises the highest number of staff, totaling 543 employees.
Surprisingly, despite its large size, only 3 employees have been retrenched from Level 1. This indicates a relatively low retrenchment rate at this organizational tier.

-Level 2:

Level 2 consists of 534 staff members.
In contrast to Level 1, Level 2 has seen a slightly higher number of retrenchments, with 11 employees affected. However, given the substantial workforce size, the retrenchment
rate remains relatively moderate.

-Level 3:

Moving to Level 3, there are 218 employees in this tier.
Here, the number of retrenched staff rises noticeably to 23, signifying a more pronounced impact on this organizational level.

-Level 4:

-Level 4 includes 106 employees.
In this tier, the retrenchment figure significantly increases to 45, indicating a relatively higher retrenchment rate when compared to the previous levels.

-Level 5:

The fifth level consists of 69 employees.
Impressively, despite its smaller size compared to other levels, Level 5 has witnessed a substantial retrenchment count of 35, highlighting the highest retrenchment rate among the
first five levels.

# Conclusion:
These insights suggest an intriguing pattern in the distribution of retrenched staff across organizational levels. While Level 1, with its substantial workforce, has managed to
maintain a lower retrenchment rate, the impact becomes progressively more pronounced as we ascend through the organizational hierarchy.

Level 5, despite having the smallest workforce among the first five levels, experiences the highest retrenchment rate. This raises questions about the specific factors contributing
to the decision-making process regarding retrenchment within the organization. Further investigation is warranted to determine the underlying reasons for this pattern, including
factors such as departmental functions, performance metrics, or strategic objectives.
